# Smart Job Tracker & Resume Matcher (NLP)

A web app built with Flask + NLP to compare your resume with job descriptions and generate a match score.
It highlights matched & missing skills to help you tailor your resume for each role.

## Features
- Upload your resume (PDF/DOCX/TXT) or paste text
- Paste job description
- NLP-based similarity using TF-IDF cosine
- Extracts skills from a customizable data/skills.csv
- Shows Match Score (0–100), Matched Skills, and Missing Skills
- Saves jobs with company, role, and location in the SQLite database
- Clean Bootstrap UI

## Future Improvements

- User authentication (login/register)
- Analytics dashboard (track scores over time, most common missing skills)
- Export jobs & scores as CSV
- Auto-suggest resume bullet points for missing skills
